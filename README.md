## Backend 
<h3>Rest Framework API with Django</h3>

<br>

## Frontend 

<h3>React and Bootsrap</h3>

<br><br>


<p> This is a Movies API build with django on the backend and React on the frontend with both of the servers running.
  
 React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes this CRUD app run extremely fast. </p>
